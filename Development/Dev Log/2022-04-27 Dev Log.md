## Objectives
- Today, I'm just reviewing how to setup my plugin to be testable. I'm starting with the one resoure I've found on testing in Obsidian:
	- [Plugin Testing for Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OviNyXnvi-o)
	- Jest seems to be the leading test framework (or at least the most commonly used amongst Obsidian plugin devs; mocha is another, but not as commonly used)
	- Dataview plugin has a pretty big test suite in `src/test`
