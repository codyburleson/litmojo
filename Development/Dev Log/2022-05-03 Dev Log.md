## Objectives

The best React tree control I could find that seems to have the features I need is:

[**React Arborist**](https://github.com/brimdata/react-arborist) - A full-featured tree component for React.

My goal today is to just start experimenting with the tree control in a separate, stand-alone project so that I can get familiar with it before muddying up any of the plugin code. This will also give me a separate prototype, outside of the plugin code base, where I can test out various things like, for example, the data model that I'll need to feed into the tree.


## Create React App

First, I use create-react-app to quickly spin up a prototype environment, a sandbox, to play in...

```
npx create-react-app sandbox
cd sandbox
npm start
```

In `App.js`, I'm placing the conainer that a view in obsidian creates...

```
<div class="workspace-leaf-content" data-type="collection-manager">
	<div class="view-content"><h4>Hello, React!</h4></div>
</div>
```

And The CSS that we get by default in Obsidian will go into `App.css`...

```css
.workspace-leaf-content .view-content {
    padding: 20px 10px;
    overflow: auto;
}
```

This renders the following...

...which sort of corresponds to what is, right now, also coming out from the LitMojo plugin in Obsidian...

Note: I renamed `sandbox` to `.sandbox` so that the directory is not visible in Obsidian when using the vault (I like to keep them together though, so that it all goes into the same repo in GitHub; it all goes together).
