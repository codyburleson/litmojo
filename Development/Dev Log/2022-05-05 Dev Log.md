## Objectives

Start a Stencil.js project to start developing web components of my own and nevermind React. I've changed my mind. And that means pulling the react integration out of the plugin code base as it is now (rolling back).

## Rationale

I did some more fiddling with the react-arborist tree control and realized that, while appears to have the features needed, it's just very poorly documented. And not only that, bedcause of my lack of skills in React, it's poses a risk for me. I could get better at React, sure, but if I'm going to be putting my time into learning something, that's not where I want my time to go. I want to build for longevity and flexibility and not get tied to any particular framework that may be popular today, but not tomorrow. If I'm going to be using web components in my UI, then they should be W3C standard web components that can work with any framework or no framework at all.

## Remove the .sandbox

I'm pivoting, so, I have deleting the `.sandbox` directory inside the vault; just through Windows File Explorer.

## Uninstall React

Basically, just reversing what I did before...

- Remove from `package.json` file:
	- `react`
	- `react-dom`
	- `@types/react`
	- `@types/react-dom`
- Delete the `node_modules` directory
- Remove from the `compilerOptions` object in `tsconfig.json`...
```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {    "jsx": "react"  }
}
```
- Run `npm install`
- Update `CollectionManagerView.tsx` (back to the starting point without React)
- Delete ReactView.tsx
- Rename `CollectionManagerView.tsx` to `collection-manager-view.ts`
- Run a visual test (i.e. `npm run dev` and check the plugin view in Obsidian)
- Commit changes.

## Create a Stencil Project in the Repo

See: [Getting Started](https://stenciljs.com/docs/getting-started)](https://stenciljs.com/docs/getting-started), stenciljs.com

`npm init stencil`

Choose the component starter

Project name: `glass-web-components`

```
cd glass-web-components
npm i
npm start
```

Works...

**Commit:** git commit -m "Add StencilJS component starter, 'glass-web-components'."

## Create a component

In glass-web-components/src/components/tree

```ts
import { Component, Prop, h } from '@stencil/core';

// Some details element styling tips
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10813581/can-i-replace-the-expand-icon-of-the-details-element


@Component({
  tag: 'glass-tree',
})
export class Tree {

  // Indicate that name should be a public property on the component
  @Prop() name: string;

  render() {
    return (
      <p>
        My name is {this.name}
      </p>
    );
  }
}
```

I updated the index page to include the new component and voila...

Stupid simple, I know. It's just step one.
