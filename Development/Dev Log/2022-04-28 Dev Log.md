## Objectives
I'm pretty sure now that I want to use react for a UI Library, so today, I'm setting up the plugin to use React and then just doing a simple acid test to make sure that it's set up properly.

I'm going by the advanced guide from Marcus Olsson's Obsidian [React](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs/advanced-guides/react) plugin developer docs. This document assumes we have a custom view to begin with. As we've only started with the Obsidian Sample Plugin, we do not yet have a custom view, so we'll start there.

Luckily, Marcus has again shown us the way in his Obsidian Plugin Developer Developer docs: [Custom views](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs/guides/custom-views).

What to call the view? 

This will be the basis for the [[Manage and Compile Collections]] feature, so how about, "CollectionManagerView."

**CollectionManagerView.ts**

```ts
import { ItemView, WorkspaceLeaf } from "obsidian";

export const VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER = "collection-manager";

export class CollectionManagerView extends ItemView {
  constructor(leaf: WorkspaceLeaf) {
    super(leaf);
  }

  getViewType() {
    return VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER;
  }

  getDisplayText() {
    return "Collection Manager view";
  }

  async onOpen() {
    const container = this.containerEl.children[1];
    container.empty();
    container.createEl("h4", { text: "Collection Manager" });
  }

  async onClose() {
    // Nothing to clean up.
  }
}
```

Custom views need to be registered when the plugin is enabled, and cleaned up when the plugin is disabled:

**main.ts**

Import our view and VIEW_TYPE constant...

```ts
import { CollectionManagerView, VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER } from "./CollectionManagerView";
```

In the onload() function, we register the view just after loadSettings()...

```ts
async onload() {
	await this.loadSettings();

	this.registerView(
		VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER,
		(leaf) => new CollectionManagerView(leaf)
	);
	//...
}
```

We must also unload the view whenever onunload is called...

```ts
async onunload() {
	this.app.workspace.detachLeavesOfType(VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER);
}
```

Now we need a custom function to activate the view...

```ts
async activateCollectionManagerView() {
	this.app.workspace.detachLeavesOfType(VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER);

	await this.app.workspace.getRightLeaf(false).setViewState({
		type: VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER,
		active: true,
	});

	this.app.workspace.revealLeaf(
		this.app.workspace.getLeavesOfType(VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER)[0]
	);
}
```

And finally, we need an icon that will call that function when clicked to open the view...

We add the following into the `onload()` function:

```ts
this.addRibbonIcon("dice", "Activate Colelction Manager view", () => {
	this.activateCollectionManagerView();
});
```

It works, so I'm commiting this stable checkpoint to GitHub with the mesage **"Add Collection Manager View"**
