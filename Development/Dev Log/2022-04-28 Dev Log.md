	## Objectives
I'm pretty sure now that I want to use react for a UI Library, so today, I'm setting up the plugin to use React and then just doing a simple acid test to make sure that it's set up properly.

I'm going by the advanced guide from Marcus Olsson's Obsidian [React](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs/advanced-guides/react) plugin developer docs. This document assumes we have a custom view to begin with. As we've only started with the Obsidian Sample Plugin, we do not yet have a custom view, so we'll start there.

Luckily, Marcus has again shown us the way in his Obsidian Plugin Developer Developer docs: [Custom views](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs/guides/custom-views).

What to call the view? 

This will be the basis for the [[Manage and Compile Collections]] feature, so how about, "CollectionManagerView."

**CollectionManagerView.ts**

```ts
import { ItemView, WorkspaceLeaf } from "obsidian";

export const VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER = "collection-manager";

export class CollectionManagerView extends ItemView {
  constructor(leaf: WorkspaceLeaf) {
    super(leaf);
  }

  getViewType() {
    return VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER;
  }

  getDisplayText() {
    return "Collection Manager view";
  }

  async onOpen() {
    const container = this.containerEl.children[1];
    container.empty();
    container.createEl("h4", { text: "Collection Manager" });
  }

  async onClose() {
    // Nothing to clean up.
  }
}
```

Custom views need to be registered when the plugin is enabled, and cleaned up when the plugin is disabled:

**main.ts**

Import our view and VIEW_TYPE constant...

```ts
import { CollectionManagerView, VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER } from "./CollectionManagerView";
```

In the onload() function, we register the view just after loadSettings()...

```ts
async onload() {
	await this.loadSettings();

	this.registerView(
		VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER,
		(leaf) => new CollectionManagerView(leaf)
	);
	//...
}
```

We must also unload the view whenever onunload is called...

```ts
async onunload() {
	this.app.workspace.detachLeavesOfType(VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER);
}
```

Now we need a custom function to activate the view...

```ts
async activateCollectionManagerView() {
	this.app.workspace.detachLeavesOfType(VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER);

	await this.app.workspace.getRightLeaf(false).setViewState({
		type: VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER,
		active: true,
	});

	this.app.workspace.revealLeaf(
		this.app.workspace.getLeavesOfType(VIEW_TYPE_COLLECTION_MANAGER)[0]
	);
}
```

And finally, we need an icon that will call that function when clicked to open the view...

We add the following into the `onload()` function:

```ts
this.addRibbonIcon("dice", "Activate Colelction Manager view", () => {
	this.activateCollectionManagerView();
});
```

It works, so I'm commiting this stable checkpoint to GitHub with the mesage **"Add Collection Manager View"**

## Install React

```bash
npm install react react-dom
```

Add type definitions...

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom
```

In `tsconfig.json`, enable JSX support on the `compilerOptions` object:
    
**tsconfig.json**
    
```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {    "jsx": "react"  }
}
```

## Create a React component

Create a new file called `ReactView.tsx` in the plugin root directory, with the following content:

**ReactView.tsx**

```
import * as React from "react";
export const ReactView = () => {  return <h4>Hello, React!</h4>;};
```

## Mount the React component

**CollectionManagerView.tsx**

Note that now we've had to rename the view extension to tsx.

```ts
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { ReactView } from "./ReactView";

//...

  async onOpen() {
    ReactDOM.render(
      <ReactView />,
      this.containerEl.children[1]
    );
  }

//...

  async onClose() {
    ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(this.containerEl.children[1]);
  }

//...


```

Looks good!

Well, actually, it looks pretty freagin' boring, but it proves the React is working, so now we'll commit the stable checkpoint with message: **"Add and integrate React"**

For more information on `ReactDOM.render()` and `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode()`, refer to the documentation on [ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html).

You can mount your React component on any `HTMLElement`, for example [status bar items](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs/guides/status-bar). Just make sure to clean up properly by calling `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode()` when you're done.

I'm going to go ahead and do this next step because, it sounds like it's good to learn, even if not necessary in the short term...

## Create an App context
Source: [Create an App context](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs/advanced-guides/react#create-an-app-context)

I am not yet going to use this part because it only works for functional components anyway and not classes. I'm not sure I know enough about using functional components versus classes yet, so I can just come back to this later if needed.
