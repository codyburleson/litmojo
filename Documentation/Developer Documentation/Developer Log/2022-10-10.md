Today, I just learned about and installed:

- [Folder Note Core](https://github.com/aidenlx/folder-note-core)
- [AidenLx's Folder Note](https://github.com/aidenlx/alx-folder-note)

 I am thinking that LitMojo will use folder notes to store metadata for the collection the folder represents, whether a manuscript, section, chapter, scene, or snippet. Folder Note Core is required by AidenLx's Folder Note plugin and it also provides the core API funtionality for other plugins to leverage.
