Compile manuscripts will go into any folder that is specified in the `litmojo.path` setting of the manuscript folder note's frontmatter.

For example, take a look at the frontmatter in the manbuscript folder note for [[Frankenstein]].

It has the following frontmatter:

```
---
litmojo:
  path: Compiled Manuscripts/Frankenstein.md
---
```

The path property specifies that the compiled manuscript should be named "Frankenstein.md" and placed in the Compiled Manuscripts folder. So, it will be placed here in this folder, alongside this file. 

Try it! Navigate into the Example Manuscripts folder, right-click on the Frankenstein folder, and choose Compile.
