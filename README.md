**Welcome to the LitMojo project** - my totally open, totally transparent, community-centered mission to create a killer Obsidian plugin for writing and publishing.

## Vision
Even the very best tools available for writers today are woefully inadequate (IMO). They say that "necessity is the mother of invention." Well, I'm tired of tying a bunch of poorly integrated applications and services together only to leave a plethora of gaps yet unfilled. For writing and publishing, I need something better - I need something more. I'm not waiting for someone else to get it right. I need what I need and I need it yesterday. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is my favorite app and where I do most of my daily thinking and writing. It has a pluggable architecture, so I think maybe I can use it as an integral part of the platform I need. We'll see how it goes.
