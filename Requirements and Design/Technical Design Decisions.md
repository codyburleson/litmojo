Everything is hypothesis under test. Here is what's decided, but only "so far." It's based on what's known now.

- Jest for testing. See: [[2022-04-27 Dev Log]]
- Stencil.js and our own standard (no framework) web components; no UI framework - just the Obsidian UI components and our own W3C compliant web components. See: [[2022-05-05 Dev Log]]
- Leverage Dataview as a dependency
	- It already has a powerful API and file / metadata mechanisms, so why reinvent any of that?
